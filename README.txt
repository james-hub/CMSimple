Please DO NOT change the password directly in
config.php by using a text editor, because the
config.php only contains the encrypted password.
Change the default password right away after
login ONLINE !
(Login with default password "test")

This is the easiest and best working way.


For editing CMSimple_XH files it is essential
to USE ONLY editors, capable of detecting,
opening and saving files as "utf-8 without BOM"
(Byte Order Mark), like notepad++.

If this condition is not fulfilled, you will
damage your CMSimple installation.


If you have forgotten your password, you can
enter the encrypted password "test", i.e.:

\$P\$BHYRVbjeM5YAvnwX2AkXnyqjLhQAod1

via ftp into config.php and login using "test".

CMSimple_XH is a fast, small, easy-to-use and
easy-to-install modular Content Management
System (CMS), which doesn't need a database.

It is free Open Source Software under the
GPL3 Licence.

CMSimple_XH stores the content of the different
pages in one single html-file (content.htm).

In default setting headings H1-H3 are used
to split the content.htm into single pages
and to generate the navigation menu, while
headings H4-H6 remain for normal semantic
structuring within pages.
